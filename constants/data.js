      `My name is Ruthvik Mukkamala.`,
      `I have always been enchanted with human innovation - from the construction of the Roman colosseum to the Holland Tunnel I believe creating for the future is the most meaningful way to spend my time.`,

       Throughout my undergraduate journey, I have been fortunate to have incredible mentors who have provided me resources to pursue my goals.`,
      `I hope this website serves as a resource for others and and my gratitude for those who helped me pursue my goals.`,
